# Whale_Tracker
JS app designed to track whales and other marine life by location or get some basic info about a specific species. The app uses two API's. Google Maps and [Whalemuseum api](https://hotline.whalemuseum.org)

# Usage
Select a species from the drop-down menu to get some general info about it, or search for a specific species on the map to get it's sightings and basic info on each sighting. The results are limited due to the whalesmuseum database.
